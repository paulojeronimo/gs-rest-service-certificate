== Generate a certificate signing request (CSR)

To generate a CSR, type:

----
$ ./generate-csr
----

The link:generate-csr[] script will generate two files:

----
$ tree generated
generated
|-- gs-rest-service.paulojeronimo.com.csr
`-- gs-rest-service.paulojeronimo.com.pfx
----

The file `gs-rest-service.paulojeronimo.com.pfx` is the keystore in `PKCS#12` format.

The file `gs-rest-service.paulojeronimo.com.csr` is the CSR. You must send it to the the certificate authority (CA) in order to receive your certificate (CRT).

See the script link:generated-csr[] for details.

== Install a certificate

After receive the certificate files from your CA, create a directory `received-from-ca` and put theses files into it, like the following example:

----
$ tree received-from-ca
----

The CA root certificate (cacert.pem) needs to be installed in the keystore first.

After that, call the script `install-crt`.
